    name: "Brian Thomas",
    bio: [
      "From the vibrant streets of Port of Spain, Trinidad, where I grew up immersed in the rich flavors of the Caribbean, my culinary journey began under the loving guidance of my grandparents. Their passion for food and mastery of flavor ignited my own passion for cooking. To hone my skills in blending local and international cuisine, I studied at the prestigious Trinidad and Tobago Hospitality Institute (TTHI), the Caribbean's mecca for culinary excellence. I've had the honor of working in some of Trinidad and Tobago's top-rated restaurants such as Crew's Inn Lighthouse Restaurant, Trotters, Prime Restaurant & Steakhouse, Texas De Brazil, Rizzoni's, and Chaud, holding positions from Line Cook to Sous Chef.",
      "After serving in some of the best kitchens, I transitioned to a new adventure as a Campboss in the Oil and Gas industry, working across Nicaragua, Aruba, Guyana, and back home in Trinidad & Tobago. For the last 9 years. I've continued to lead as a head chef, serving diverse teams across multiple countries. Now, I'm excited to bring my culinary experience and love for bold flavours to Tropical Cafe - where Caribbean soul meets international flair. Come join me on this new journey as we serve up dishes inspired by my travels and the island I call home.",
